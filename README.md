# Deep Learning Challenge

In the Alphabet Soup Challenge (deep learning), I developed a binary classifier using neural networks to predict the success of grant applications, drawing on historical data from the nonprofit Alphabet Soup. I preprocessed a dataset of over 34,000 organizations that received funding, identifying essential features and targets for the model. My goal was to design, train, and refine a neural network model that could accurately determine the potential success of new applicants, aiming to surpass a 75% accuracy threshold in predicting effective use of the funds.
